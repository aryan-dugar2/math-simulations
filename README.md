Hello,

This is a repository of some mildly related baby projects I undertake - for example, approximating a function by its Berstein polynomial, or simulating a distribution.
They are inspired by my classes in probability, 553.720 Probability Theory 1, and my role as a TA for 553.420/620 Intro to Probability, at Johns Hopkins University.
